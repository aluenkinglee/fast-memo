# etcd

etcd is a distributed, consistent key-value store for shared configuration and service discovery, with a focus on being:

* Simple: well-defined, user-facing API (gRPC)
* Secure: automatic TLS with optional client cert authentication
* Fast: benchmarked 10,000 writes/sec
* Reliable: properly distributed using Raft
